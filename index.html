				Hi, I'm Will. I was born in 1989. After being thrust in the wild to fight a bear to the death, I became a man at 5. I spent the next 13 years killing commies who were trying to take my freedom. During that time, I was put in school, but I was so smart that I just taught all the teachers and discovered the unified theory of physics at the same time. Shortly after being awarded the nobel prize in every category because my discovery was just so rad, I moved onto being the president of the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				As president of the universe, my time was highly coveted. One time, while giving advice to then-president Obama, he said of me, "Will, you're just the most amazing, rad, groovy person that is alive and that has ever been alive." Of course, I knew this already, but I'm humble so I said, "thanks prez." I told Obama what to do in Syria, but he must have gotten hit on the head because he didn't listen to what I said, so instead of peace in the Middle East, we have what we have now. Oh well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually I got tired of being the leader of everything and resigned. That's when I spent the next 10 years nursing sick kittens back to health while fighting crime. One hand for punching bad guys in their stupid dicks and another for holding those cute little fuckers. After saving the lives of millions of fluffy little miracles, I decided it wasn't fair to limit my incredible gifts to just kittens. That's why I decided to open the worlds first hospital for animals and humans.
			</p>
			<p>
				After pioneering a method to cure cancer, I've spent every day since saving more lives.
